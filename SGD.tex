\Abstract{Pure deduction puzzles typically have a single unique
  solution.  However, some puzzle setters argue that challenges with
  multiple solutions are also valid, if they can be solved by
  eliminating choices that lead to ambiguous states.  This paper
  considers the arguments for and against this position, and presents
  a counterexample that demonstrates the danger of using uniqueness to
  decide between multiple solutions.}
